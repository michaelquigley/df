import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Key Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Data Binding Foundation" icon="puzzle">
    Bidirectional binding between Go structs and structured data (JSON, YAML, maps) with type-safe conversion and support for primitives, pointers, slices, and nested structures.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dependency Injection Container" icon="setting">
    Object management with singleton and named registration patterns, type queries for exact matching and interface compatibility, plus container introspection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Application Orchestration" icon="rocket">
    Lifecycle management with configurable phases (build → link → start → stop), factory pattern for configuration-driven object creation, and automatic dependency injection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Polymorphic Data Support" icon="random">
    Dynamic interface for runtime type discrimination, enabling flexible data structures that can adapt based on configuration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Object References" icon="link">
    Cycle-safe pointer resolution with generic `Pointer[T]` type, supporting complex object relationships and circular references.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration Merging" icon="merge">
    Layer multiple configuration sources with intelligent defaults preservation using the `Merge` function for sophisticated configuration hierarchies.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Three Integrated Layers

df provides a complete stack from low-level data binding to high-level application orchestration:

1. **Data Binding Layer** - Core functions for struct-to-map conversion with comprehensive type support
2. **Container Layer** - Dependency injection with type queries and object lifecycle management  
3. **Application Layer** - Complete orchestration with configuration-driven object creation
